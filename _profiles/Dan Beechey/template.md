I am a final-year PhD student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI (ART-AI), University of Bath, specialising in reinforcement learning.

**Research Summary**: I am interested in the capacity of AI systems with limited resources to acquire generalisable behaviours that facilitate continual learning. For further details and my publications, please refer to my website.
